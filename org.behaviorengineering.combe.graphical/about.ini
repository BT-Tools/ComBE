aboutText=ComBE provides an integrated textual and graphical editor for Behavior Engineering. The textual and graphical editors are based on Spoofax and GMF respectively and are synchronised in real-time. ComBE comes with various useful editor services, such as Selection Sharing, Reference Resolution, Code Completion, Auto-layouting and Zooming. The textual syntax of ComBE is the same as TextBE's syntax, which makes it possible to use existing .bt files. Tools based on EMF can also easily be integrated with ComBE.
